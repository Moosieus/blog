# Todo
- Style the blockquotes

# Go Live!
- Host on netlify
- Add necessary github actions

# Todo Later
- Content manipulations
  - Table of contents on each post
  - View image fullsize

- Revisit color palette (good 'nuff for now)
  - Links are too subtle on light mode
  - `rgb(138, 24, 68)` for light links?
  - Maybe redo it
