# Describe Your Errors

Go and Elixir take vastly different approaches to error handling. I'm partial to both two reasons:
- They discern between routine errors as values and errors as exceptions.
- They describe errors.

In most popular languages, it's idiomatic to present and handle all errors via exceptions. This sucks.
